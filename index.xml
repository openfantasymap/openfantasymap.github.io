The platform displays fantasy maps created in several waysa: On one hand it uses generative algorythms to create continents, countries, cities, streets, biomes, and many other elements for the players to interact with and to manage. On the other hand, it uses the tools created for Open History Map to digitize ancient maps to help artists digitize their own modern productions in order to make these maps interactively available to the players.</description></item><item><title>OFM Map Canvas</title><link>/tools/ofm-map-canvas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/tools/ofm-map-canvas/</guid><description>OFM Map Canvas is a tool enabling FoundryVTT masters to create the scenes based on data from FantasyMaps and OpenFantasyMaps, but also from OpenHistoryMap and OpenStreetMap.
