FantasyMaps Ã¨ a project by [OpenHistoryMap](https://www.openhistorymap.org) that has as its main objective the creation of maps of fantasy worlds and the tools to manage the data connected to them.

Why would we do that? 

First of all, why not?

GIS technologies have grown a lot and made cartographic visualizations way easier every day. For this reason we are trying to develop and define a system enabling you all to use these technologies to use and live the maps of the fantasy worlds you spend so much time in, in the best possible weay.
