# Serious tech for non-serious maps [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0CmGSx-8vk&ab_channel=FOSS4G)

Open Fantasy Map uses the technology of Open History Map to store data about fantasy worlds for role players to live their adventures in the best ways possible. The platform displays fantasy maps created in several waysa: On one hand it uses generative algorythms to create continents, countries, cities, streets, biomes, and many other elements for the players to interact with and to manage. On the other hand, it uses the tools created for Open History Map to digitize ancient maps to help artists digitize their own modern productions in order to make these maps interactively available to the players. The OHM technology stack enables also the forking of the world into several different situations where the players can see the impact of their actions on the world. We want to share the experience in creating both the genrative algorythms as well as the platform.
