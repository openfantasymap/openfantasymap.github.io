OFM Map Canvas is a tool enabling FoundryVTT masters to create the scenes based on data from FantasyMaps and OpenFantasyMaps, but also from OpenHistoryMap and OpenStreetMap. The module downloads the data and reconstructs the walls, roadside decorations and lights for the players to play in the most realistic setting possible.
