OFM MCP server is a useful tool to help you keep up with the lore of your game when working with your LLM. It uses real (fantasy) world positions and the connections to the various wikis on-line to keep the base lore straight.

ATTENTION: at the moment it uses http-streaming technology which is not compatible with ChatGPT pro, but only with ClaudeAI.
